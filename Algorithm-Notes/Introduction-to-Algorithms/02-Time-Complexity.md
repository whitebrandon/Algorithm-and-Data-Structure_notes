## EFFICIENCY OF AN ALGORITHM

When determing the **efficiency** of an algorithm we always want to evaluate how the algorithm performs in a worst-case scenario. We use these as a bench mark, because they can never perform worse than they do in these scenarios.

Order of growth: a measure of how much the time taken to execute operations increases as the input size increases.

Big O: a theoretical definition of the complexity of an algorithm as a function of the size.

### Linear Search: Run Time Data
| n | Worst Case Run Time |
|---|---------------------|
| 10 | 10 |
| 100 | 100 |
| 1000 | 1000 |
| 10000 | 10000 |
| 100000 | 100000 |
| 1000000 | 1000000 |
