## INTRODUCTION

### Objectives
1. Explore how arrays work
2. Learn what the common operations of an array are
3. Learn what the run times associated with those common operations are
4. Build a data type called a linked list
5. Explore ways to store data
6. Explore what motivates us to build specific types of structures
7. Expore the pros and cons of those structures
8. Explore four common operations:
  1. Accessing a value
  2. Searching for a value
  3. Inserting a value
  4. Deleting a value
9. Explore how the choice of data structure potentially influences the run tim of an algorithm

## ARRAY BASICS

[Arrays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Array_data_structure) are a fundamental data structure and can be used to represent a collection of values.

#### **Arrays can be used as building blocks to create even more custom data types and structures**.

### What is a [Data Structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_structure)?
A data storage format. It is the collection of values and the format they are stored in, the relationships between the values in the collection as well as the operations applied on the data stored in the structure.

In languages like Swift and Java, arrays are **homogeneous structures**, which means they __can only contain values of the same type__. 
  * If you use an array to store integers in Java, it can **only** store integers.

In other languages like Python and JavaScript, arrays are heterogeneous structures, which means they can contain values of different types.

The fundamental concept of the array is the index. 

In Python an array is best represented as a list. In computer science a list is actually a different structure than an array, generally those this structure is called a linked list.

And array is a contiguous data structure. In a noncontiguous data structure, the sturcture stores a values as well as a reference to where the next value is. To retrieve that next value the langage has to follow that reference (pointer) to the next block of memeory. This adds overhead which increases the runtime of certain operations. 

When an array is created, 

### Contiguous Memory
Blocks of memore situated right beside each other with no gaps.
